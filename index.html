                <h2>Who Is Birdy</h2>
                <p>I am a single mother battling anxiety, depression, OCD, and PTSD while attempting to live in a world with high expectations. I have children with high needs as well, and what I want more than life is to watch
            them succeed despite thier diagnoses. I am learning to be a better person, and let Jesus take the wheel.</p>
